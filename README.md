## About the Project
MindCouncil AI is a multi-step decision support dashboard that simulates a council of AI personas to help users analyze dilemmas, weigh risks, and make confident choices.  

Inspired by the idea of having a “team of advisors” at your fingertips, this project taught me how to integrate AI APIs, build interactive dashboards, and handle multi-step workflows. Challenges included maintaining session state across multiple steps and generating actionable insights from AI responses.
